<!-- Below is a link to a page that still has to be created -->

<p>
The setup screen for auto test is the first screen that appears when we click on Auto Test in the main menu and is used to introduce the parameters of the test that we wan to run.

<br >

<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Sample Id and Lot Number</font><br>
We can introduce the Sample Id and Lot Number which will be recorded in the output file for our reference. 
</p>
<br >

<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Save Data to File</font><br>
You have to introduce a path where the data that we acquire will be saved. Some windows folders might not be accessible to the program. You can click on the "Default Folder link" for a suggested folder. Notice that the file path has to end in .pmi. Alternatively you can click on the icon to the right to open a dialog to browse for a folder of your choice. Each time that you start a new auto test the program will increment the file with a number so that you don't overwrite data by mistake.
</p>
<br >
<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Select Sample Chamber</font><br>
This selects the chamber to which the liquid will be pumped to. The disk chamber is the smaller chamber to the left of the machine and is used to test disk samples. The ring chamber is the larger chamber to the right of the machine and is used to test ring shaped samples.
</p>
<br >
<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Sample Diameter, Sample Thickness and Viscosity</font><br>
You have to introduce the sample diameter and thickness and viscosity of the liquid so that the program can correctly calculate the permeability. The program will remember the values that you introduce and you can save viscosityosity values for oil or water by clicking on the radio buttons.
</p>
<br >
<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Program to run</font><br>
The program to run contains a list of steps that the machine will follow. By introducing a pressure, step duration and optionally temperature, and then clicking on "Add these values to the list" you can add multiple steps. You can delete a step by clicking on it in the list and then clicking on "Remove Selected Row". The program will remember your list of next the next time you launch the program.
</p>
<br >
<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Continue Button</font><br>
When you are done with this screen click on the Continue button. This will start the data acquisition and opens the main auto test screen.
