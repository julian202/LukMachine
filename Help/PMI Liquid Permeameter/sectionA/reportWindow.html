<hr>

<p>
The Report Window opens automatically at the end of an Auto Test and it can also be opened from the main screen at startup. It displays the data in a graph and also gives you the option to display it in several forms. There is an export button that gives you the option to export the data to a file in an excel format. On the bottom right is a link "Open Data Folder" which when clicked will open the folder where the data file has been saved.

<font color="#FF0000">Permeability Calculation</font><br>
The second tab of the Report Window contains a calculator to calculate permeability in Darcies. The permeability of your data is calculated during data acquisition so this calculator is not needed but might be useful.
