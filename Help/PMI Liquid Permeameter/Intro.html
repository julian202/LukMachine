<h3>Introduction to the PMI Liquid Permeameter  </h3>
<p> The PMI Liquid Permeameter pumps a liquid (typically water or oil) through one of two chambers at a predefined pressure and measures the volume of liquid that flows through the sample. The flow and pressure is used to calculate the permeability of the sample.</p>
<p> The temperatures of the chambers can be set from 0 to 200 degrees Celsius. The pressure can be set from 0 to 100 PSI. All is software controlled including custom pre-programmed profiles of temperature and pressure over time. The data is displayed in real time and a report is generated that displays the graphs of flow, temperature, pressure and permeability. Data is saved in a .pmi file that can be opened with any text editor. The data can also be exported to excel format.</p>
